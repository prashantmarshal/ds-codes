message broker
has a queue of its own
fire and forget kind of thing. pushses thigns into the queue and forgets about it. something else later deals with the stuff.
asynchronously process data.

can speak any language. any thing that talks AMQP.
only have to wait for the message to be queued and not necessarily processed.
